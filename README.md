# Universal Tool Use

This project provides a Flask-based server that emulates OpenAI's function calling/tool use API functionality through prompt engineering and code generation. It allows you to use language models that don't natively support tool use with the OpenAI tool use interface. Compatible with reasoning-focused models like QwQ and R1, as well as any general purpose model with coding ability but lacks native function calling abilities.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables:
```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # If using DeepSeek
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The server accepts the following command line arguments:
```bash
--api-key     API key for authentication (default: "lol")
--base-url    Base URL for the API (default: "http://0.0.0.0:4000/v1")
--port        Port to run the server on (default: 8001)
```

2. Make requests to the API endpoint:
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8001/v1",
    api_key="any_string"  # Not used but required
)

# Define your tools
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "City name"
                    }
                },
                "required": ["location"]
            }
        }
    }
]

# Make a request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="any-model",  # Model name is passed through
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in London?"}
    ],
    tools=tools
)
```

## Examples

The repository includes example implementations in the `examples/` directory:

### PydanticAI Banking Support Agent
A simple banking support chatbot that demonstrates type-safe tool use with PydanticAI.

To run the examples:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pydantic-ai openai

# Run the example
python examples/pydanticai.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Request Processing**
   - Validates incoming requests against OpenAI's API schema
   - Processes and combines tool messages with user messages

2. **Code Generation**
   - Generates Pydantic models from tool definitions
   - Creates function stubs for each tool
   - Formats code with proper imports and structure

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Enhances system prompts with tool information
   - Guides the LLM to output valid Python code

4. **Code Execution**
   - Extracts code snippets from LLM responses
   - Validates tool calls against defined tools
   - Executes code in isolated Jupyter notebook environment

5. **Response Formatting**
   - Formats responses to match OpenAI's API structure
   - Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses

## Why Code-Based Tool Calling?

Recent research ([Executable Code Actions](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.01030), [LLM Agents](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.01747)) has demonstrated that having LLMs express tool calls through code patterns rather than JSON format leads to better performance. This project leverages Python code patterns with Pydantic type definitions and literal value assignments for tool calling, rather than the traditional JSON-based approach.

The key insight is that LLMs are better at working with code patterns they've seen in their training data:

- **Natural Pattern Recognition:** LLMs have seen countless examples of Python variable assignments and function calls in their training data
- **Type Safety:** Pydantic type definitions provide clear structure while staying in familiar Python syntax
- **Value Assignment:** Using Python's literal value assignment is more natural for LLMs than JSON key-value pairs
- **Static Analysis:** The code output can be parsed and validated using standard Python tooling

This approach fixes a key problem with how tools are currently used. The traditional way takes something Python does naturally - calling functions - and forces it through an awkward and unnatural process:

1. Start with pure, readable Python functions
2. Convert these into static JSON schemas (losing the "function" essence)
3. Have the LLM generate rigid JSON structures for executing actions (when it's trained on billions of lines of text called "code" that actually executes actions and is the way actions have been executed on computers for decades)
4. Parse the JSON and execute relevant code

The JSON approach was chosen for good reason - JSON's static nature makes it easy to validate and parse safely. But this creates an unnecessary translation layer that fights against both Python's strengths and the LLM's training. Function calling is a fundamental programming concept that Python handles beautifully with a concise and elegant syntax, while JSON is incredibly verbose and meant for static data representation.

Our approach delivers the best of both worlds. Like JSON, Python code can be parsed and validated through static analysis. But crucially, it uses the natural function-calling patterns that LLMs have encountered billions of times during their pre-training phase. Pydantic's type definitions ‚Äì increasingly common in modern Python ‚Äì serve as a familiar alternative to JSON schemas while maintaining rigor.

This works because LLMs speak code natively. Respecting function signatures and Pydantic data shapes is a core skill, baked into their training through endless examples of Python code. JSON schemas for function calling, however, are artificial constructs rarely seen in public internet training data. They force models into unnatural patterns ‚Äì rigid structures the AI has only encountered during post-training. JSON tool calling relies on carefully balanced fine-tuning artifacts, while Python generation builds on the model's core unsupervised competency - manipulating actual code patterns seen in billions of pretraining examples.

By using Python as nature intended, we align with the model's inherent understanding of executable logic and data shapes rather than forcing unnatural constraints. It also allows to use function calling on any model that can generate python code, whether it has been trained for tool use or not.

(Note: For convenience, we currently execute the code directly without static analysis or parsing. Adding these safety features remains a future enhancement.)

## API Compatibility Benefits

This compatibility layer allows you to leverage the growing ecosystem of AI tools while using your preferred language model.

## Security Considerations

WARNING: Current implementation has security limitations:

- Code execution in Jupyter notebooks still allows file I/O operations
- Import restrictions can be bypassed through certain Python features
- No memory/CPU usage limits on code execution
- No network access restrictions
- Temporary files may persist if cleanup fails
- Request logs could expose sensitive data

Use caution when deploying in production environments. Additional security measures recommended:

- Run in containerized environment with strict resource limits
- Implement proper authentication and rate limiting
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Consider alternatives to direct code execution

## Limitations

- Relies on LLM's ability to generate valid Python code
- Limited error recovery options
- May require more prompt engineering for complex tools
- Uses the same prompt for all models and may or may not work well with different models
